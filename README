	The Makefile contains targets for compiling and running your
	program. DO NOT MODIFY.

	The README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to fill
	the README with the write-up for your project. You should
	explain design decisions, explain why your code is correct, and
	why your test cases are adequate. It is part of the assignment
	to clearly and concisely explain things in text as well as to
	comment your code.  Just edit this file.

	good.cl and bad.cl test a few features of the semantic checker.
	You should add tests to ensure that good.cl exercises as many
	legal semantic combinations as possible and that bad.cl
	exercises as many kinds of semantic errors as possible.

	cool-tree.aps contains the definitions for the tree language
	which you use to construct the abstract syntax tree (AST). This
	file is provided for your reference.  DO NOT MODIFY.

        TreeNode.java and ListNode.java contain definitions used by the
        tree package. DO NOT MODIFY.  

        cool-tree.java specifies and gives an implementation of Cool ASTs
        (see the README for PA3 and the "Cool Tour").  In this
        assignment, you will need to add functions to the AST classes to
        store, fetch, and compute information about the AST.

   	You should NOT remove any definitions that are already present
   	in cool-tree.java.  These function and data members are required
   	for the system to function properly.

        You should add any fields and methods to the classes you need to
        perform semantic analysis.  You will need to add, for example,
        methods which traverse the expressions of the tree and implement
        the type-checking rules.  The entry point to the semantic
        analyzer is program.semant().

	ClassTable.java implements a placeholder class for a few useful
	methods.  Feel free to extend it to implement some real data
	strucutre.

	TreeConstants.java defined some useful symbol constants.  You
	may add some of your own, if you wish.

	ASTLexer.java, ASTParser.java, and ASTConstants.java implement a
	lexer and a parser for reading text representation of ASTs from
	console in the format produced by the parser phase. DO NOT
	MODIFY.

        Semant.java contains a driver to test the analyzer.  The main
        method reads an AST in text form from standard input, parses it,
        and then produces a type-annotated AST on standard output.  The
        script mycoolc can pass any of the standard flags to the
        semantic analyzer as well; for this assignment, -s (semantic
        analysis debug) may be useful as it sets a static variable
        Flags.semant_debug to "true".  If you want your semantic checker
        to print debug information when the option is set, write your
        debug code in the following format:

	      if (Flags.semant_debug)
	      {
		...
	      }

	semant_debug is provided as a convenience. You don't need to use
	the debugging flags if you don't want to. DON'T MODIFY
	Semant.java

	SymbolTable.java contains a symbol table implementation. Read
	the comments in the file and look at the example in
	SymtabExample.java.  You are not required to use this code, but
	you may find it useful. DO NOT MODIFY.

Instructions
------------

	To compile the example use of the symbol table, type

	% gmake symtab-example

	This creates a shell script to run the symbol table example.

	To compile your semantic analyzer program type:

	% gmake semant

	To test your semantic checker, type:

	% mysemant foo.cl

	mysemant is a version of mycoolc that omits code generation.
	mysemant parses all the cool files given on the command line and
	builds a single abstract syntax tree containing all class
	definitions appearing in the input files. Your semantic checker
	is then called on this abstract syntax tree.  If there are no
	errors, the program produces a type-annotated abstract syntax
	tree as output.

	To run your checker on the files good.cl and bad.cl type:

	% gmake dotest

	If you think your semantic checker is correct and behaves like
	the one we wrote, you can try to run mycoolc using your checker,
	your parser and also your lexical analyzer if you choose (see
	below for instructions).  Remember if your lexer, parser or
	checker behaves in an unexpected manner, you may get errors
	anywhere.

	To turnin your work type:

	% gmake submit-clean

	And run the "submit" program following the instructions on the
	course web page.
	
	Running "submit" will collect the files cool-tree.java,
	ClassTable.java, TreeConstants.java, good.cl, bad.cl,
	good.output, bad.output, and README. Don't forget to edit the
	README file to include your write-up, and to write your own test
	cases in good.cl and bad.cl.

 	You may turn in the assignment as many times as you like.
 	However, only the last version will be retained for grading.

	If you change architectures you must issue

	% gmake clean

	when you switch from one type of machine to the other.
	If at some point you get weird errors from the linker,	
	you probably forgot this step.

	GOOD LUCK!

Write-up for PA4
----------------
Our approach to this assignment centered around our use of two custom data structures, the Context and the ClassTable. We designed the Context as a wrapper around and interface to all the necessary environment information, namely:
  - The variable environment
  - The method signatures
  - The current class
By wrapping all of these in a single interface, we simplified the semant code considerably:
  - We only have to pass one object around our semant() methods
  - We don't have to worry client-side about whether to invoke getVarType (for example) on the class table, the method table, or the symbol table--we only interface with the Context.
  - Similarly, it simplified the interface with the scoping mechanisms: the client could simply call (eg) Context::enterClass(class_c klass) and the Context would take care of whatever needed to be done, eg adding attributes to the symbol table; the client could then just call leaveClass when they were finished. 
Inside the Context, we have the following components:
  - VariableEnvironment
    - This is an extended custom version of the SymbolTable (which is the provided stack-of-hashmaps implementation of a variable scoping data structure). Our custom version allowed us to add additional functionality which we used early on in debugging, and it allowed us to provide the SymbolTable with an indirect hook into the ClassTable (where the error-printing methods are defined).
  - ClassTable
    - This provided:
      - The class hierarchy/inheritance graph
      - Error-checking (of inheritance cycles, illegal inheritance of primitives or invalid classes, of double-defined classes, valid Main class with main() method, etc)
      - Enforcing correct method overloading (identical signatures)
      - The ability to check whether classes (in dispatches, etc) are valid and defined
      - The mechanisms to look up methods or attributes of a given class (or its parents)
      - A simple hook to check whether one class is a subclass of another
      - A simple hook to check the least upper-bound of two classes
      - (Note: since the Context has access to every environment, we were able to deal with SELF_TYPE for isSubclass and leastUpperBound at the Context level, allowing the client to happily pass SELF_TYPE into these calls and get the correct result.)
      - The printstream used for error reporting
  - The current class ("where we are" at any given time in the parsing)
The Context provides a number of simplified interfaces between the semant() client methods and the various Tables, such as "getReturnType" and "getParameters" methods (see above for more examples)

Once we built our abstractions, we simply added a semant(Context) method to each AST node. Our core semant code recursively traverses these semant methods, relying on the Context for all necessary information.



Our semantic analyzer does two passes over the AST.
The first pass handles:
- Creating the ClassTable
  - Adds the "starter classes" (Object, String etc) as well as every class in the file to a Map from <Class_Name> to <Class_Object>, and performs the following checks on each:
    - Verifies no class is doubly defined
    - Verifies no inheritance cycles by following each class up the inheritance tree until it reaches object (or hits an error: invalid class, repeated cycle of parent classes, or a "primitive" class)
    - Verifies each class:
      - Checks for doubly-defined attributes and methods.
      - Enforces inheritance rules (inherited attributes cannot be redefined; inherited methods must have identical signatures)
  - Checks for a Main method with a main() method

The second pass traverses the AST. We only do our second pass if the first pass comes back error-free.
The second pass:
- Recursively visits and "semants" every node. Every node is responsbile for checking its own inference rules (in the C, M, and O contexts dictated by the Context object) and calling semant on all of its children.
- This pass catches many errors, including:
  - mismatched return
